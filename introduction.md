## Introduction

MIND Lab (Maryland Information and Network Dynamics Lab) is a Research Lab studying various topic, I’m currently working on a breathing project, which researchers collected breathing data from random people on campus during the last couple of years. And we are developing a Web-App and better virtualization of the breathing data for researchers or visitors.
I'm currently a member in MIND and I’m developing a research tool. My audience are mainly undergraduate or graduate computer science or computer engineering students in the breathing project and they should be categorized as technicians or experts. From the experience of the process perspective, I wrote the script, so I know everything about it from the development to the usage.
I will give series of instruction to researchers in order to inform them the usage of the python script. We have a large amount of data need to be processed and the script I wrote is meant to be used to generalize the data into a designated form so that they are easier to be accessed and used. The program will be mainly executed on command prompt, that means user need to have access to a computer with network, user also should have basic knowledge of version control tool and UNIX commands. It's important some of the members in breathing project know how to use the tool because we have some other projects that relies on the processed data.
